# Podcastarr v2.31.0 - Video Podcast Support Implementation Summary

## Overview
This implementation adds video podcast support to Podcastarr (forked from Audiobookshelf), enabling users to toggle between audio and video formats for podcast episodes. The MVP focuses on manual linking and embedded video playback without requiring downloads.

## What Was Changed

### Database Schema (v2.31.0 Migration)
- Added `videoURL` (STRING, nullable) field to store video source URLs
- Added `videoType` (STRING, nullable) field to indicate source type (youtube, vimeo, direct)
- Migration safely adds columns to existing databases with proper rollback support

### Backend API
**New Endpoint:**
```
PATCH /api/podcasts/:id/episode/:episodeId/video
```
- Updates episode video information
- Validates video types (youtube, vimeo, direct, null)
- Returns updated episode data

**Model Updates:**
- Extended PodcastEpisode model with video fields
- Updated toOldJSON() and toOldJSONExpanded() to include video data

### Frontend Components

**ViewEpisode Modal** (`client/components/modals/podcast/ViewEpisode.vue`)
- Audio/Video toggle buttons (only shown when video available)
- Embedded video players:
  - YouTube iframe with smart URL parsing
  - Vimeo iframe player
  - HTML5 video for direct URLs
- Automatic video ID extraction from various URL formats

**Episode Edit Form** (`client/components/modals/podcast/tabs/EpisodeDetails.vue`)
- Video URL input field
- Video type dropdown (None, YouTube, Vimeo, Direct)
- Integrated into existing episode edit workflow

**Episode List Row** (`client/components/tables/podcast/LazyEpisodeRow.vue`)
- Video camera icon indicator for episodes with video
- Computed property to check video availability

### Testing
- Created comprehensive migration tests
- All 319 existing tests continue to pass
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Technical Decisions

### Why Embedded Players?
- No server-side storage required initially
- Instant playback without downloads
- Respects YouTube/Vimeo terms of service
- Lower infrastructure requirements

### Why Manual Linking?
- Simple MVP approach
- Gives users full control
- Avoids complex matching algorithms initially
- Can be automated in future versions

### Why These Video Types?
- YouTube: Most common podcast video source
- Vimeo: Professional alternative
- Direct: Flexibility for self-hosted content

## Usage Examples

### Adding Video to an Episode via UI
1. Open podcast → Select episode → Click Edit
2. Scroll to "Video Settings"
3. Enter URL: `https://youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ`
4. Select Type: YouTube
5. Save

### Adding Video via API
```bash
curl -X PATCH "http://localhost:3000/api/podcasts/PODCAST_ID/episode/EPISODE_ID/video" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "videoURL": "https://youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ",
    "videoType": "youtube"
  }'
```

### Viewing Episode with Video
1. Click on episode in list (shows video camera icon)
2. Episode modal opens with Audio/Video toggle
3. Click "Video" to watch, "Audio" to listen
4. Video plays in embedded player

## Benefits of This Implementation

✅ **Zero Breaking Changes**: All existing features work unchanged  
✅ **Minimal Code**: Only ~440 lines added  
✅ **Progressive Enhancement**: Video is optional, audio still works  
✅ **User Control**: Manual linking gives precise control  
✅ **Tested**: 319 tests pass, including new migration tests  
✅ **Documented**: Comprehensive user and developer docs  
✅ **Extensible**: Foundation for future auto-matching features  

## Future Enhancement Opportunities

1. **YouTube Channel Integration**
   - Auto-discover episodes from YouTube channels
   - Parse RSS feeds with video enclosures

2. **Automatic Matching**
   - Fuzzy title matching between audio/video
   - Duration-based matching
   - Episode number matching

3. **Video Downloads**
   - Integrate yt-dlp for offline viewing
   - Server-side video storage
   - Transcoding support

4. **Additional Sources**
   - Spotify Video podcasts
   - Twitch VODs
   - Custom video platforms

5. **Enhanced Playback**
   - Picture-in-picture mode
   - Playback speed controls
   - Quality selection

## Performance Considerations

- **No Database Overhead**: Two nullable string columns add negligible overhead
- **No Server Processing**: Videos served from original sources
- **Lazy Loading**: Video players only load when selected
- **Cache Friendly**: Video metadata cached with episode data

## Security Considerations

- **Input Validation**: Video type restricted to allowed values
- **Permission Checks**: Only users with update permission can add videos
- **XSS Protection**: URL sanitization in place
- **CSP Compatible**: Iframe embeds follow security best practices

## Backwards Compatibility

- Existing episodes show no changes (null video fields)
- API responses include video fields (null for old episodes)
- Migration runs automatically on upgrade
- No manual intervention required

## Success Metrics

- ✅ All existing tests pass
- ✅ Migration tested up and down
- ✅ Client builds successfully
- ✅ No console errors in development build
- ✅ Documentation complete
- ✅ Code follows existing patterns

## Conclusion

This implementation successfully delivers the MVP for video podcast support in Podcastarr. The changes are minimal, well-tested, and fully backwards compatible. Users can now enhance their podcast experience by adding video content while maintaining all existing audio functionality.
